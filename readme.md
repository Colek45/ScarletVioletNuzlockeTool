# Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet: Nuzlocke Tool (Alpha) #
#### Created by Don Piccolo and dshink (neither of us have anything to plug) ####

Since Scarlet and Violet don't do encounters the same way as any other Pokemon game, we decided to implement our own tool to roll encounters. As a result, this project was born. This is the alpha version of the project, so it doesn't work perfectly, though if you have any questions, feel free to message me on Discord (Don Piccolo#8534).

The current version handles version exclusives, level caps, duplicates, failed catches, and branching evolutions.

To make the randomizer tool work, either run the exe file from dist/main or run main.py from the terminal. Saving and loading is a little buggy, but does work if you save in the main folder.

Big things for this release and what we need to work on for future releases:
* Resolution
* Fixing Layout
* General bug testing for saving and loading 
* Add a reroll feature
* Add an evolution button

Special thanks go to Serebii and PokemonDB for having the pokemon data and encounter data that we used to create the encounter rates.
