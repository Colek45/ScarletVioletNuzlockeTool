# Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet: Nuzlocke Tool (Beta) #
#### Created by Don Piccolo and dshink (neither of us have anything to plug) ####

Since Scarlet and Violet don't do encounters the same way as any other Pokemon game, we decided to implement our own tool to roll encounters. As a result, this project was born. This is the beta version of the project, so it doesn't work perfectly, though if you have any questions, feel free to message me on Discord (Don Piccolo#8534).

The current version handles version exclusives, level caps, duplicates, failed catches, rerolling, error handling, and branching evolutions.

To run the program, download the entire repository and from your command line/terminal, run 'python3 main.py'. Another option is that there is an exe file inside of the dist/main folder that can run the program. You can save and load your progress using the save and load buttons respectively to anywhere on your computer.

Here is what we need to work on for the final release:
* Fixing Layout
* Add an evolution button
* Make executable easier to activate
* Make executable available on OSX
* Make tutorial video

Special thanks go to Serebii and PokemonDB for having the pokemon data and encounter data that we used to create the encounter rates.

If you dig through the files, there is an easter egg...
